  1. Clone the repo:                                                                                                
  git clone https://github.com/bonawinn/news-dashboard.git  
  cd news-dashboard                                                                                                 
  2. Install dependencies:                                                                                          
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  3. Create the .env file (since it's not in the repo):
  echo "BRAVE_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
  4. Run it:
  python app.py
